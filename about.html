<h3>Research Ethics Committee</h3>  
With the universityâ€™s commitment to academic excellence and quality research, the St. Paul University Philippines Research Ethics Committee (SPUP REC), a multidisciplinary and multisectoral body, is mandated to ensure the scientific and ethical conduct of research involving human participants undertaken by faculty members, students, staff, alumni, and other stakeholders. It is also tasked to formulate, implement, and evaluate policy and procedures regarding adherence to research ethical standards. <p>
The SPUP REC operates as an independent committee but under the oversight of the Center for Planning, Research, Innovations, and New Technologies (CPRINT).
